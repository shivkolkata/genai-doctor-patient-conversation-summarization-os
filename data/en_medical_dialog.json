Or any burning sensation in the epigastric region, the center of your chest (heartburn). If you do, it could also present as chest pain so I will guide you accordingly. I would also like to rule out any muscular pain, for which I will encourage you to take a muscle relaxant and see if it helps. Take tablet Muscoril (Thiocholchicoside 4 mg) one tablet once a day when you experience pain and let me know in the follow up in a couple of days to see if it relieves the pain. Like you said your Vitamin B12 levels are below normal, it could also be neuropathic pain for which I will only advise vitamin B12 supplements (tablet Methycolbalmine once a day for three months) or B complex supplements. You can also improve these levels with diet. Take diet enriched with beef, liver, and chicken. Fish and shellfish such as trout, salmon, tuna fish, and clams. Fortified breakfast cereal. Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. Since your Hb is also below the ideal levels, take iron-rich foods which are usually Vitamin B12 rich as well. So I will advise diet modification to incorporate these in your everyday routine or take supplements with iron and Vitamin B12 as well. Because anemia can also present with the said symptoms. Lastly, I will encourage you to reduce weight with exercise and changing your diet and switching to a low-fat diet with the addition of more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Try to start with atleast 30-40 minutes of cardio workout every day and work it up from there according to your stamina and you will see the visible change that you feel. You will feel more active and fresh. Try to bring your BMI (body mass index) as close to the normal range as you can. Because obesity itself can cause countless problems as well. I hope this helps.

Or any burning sensation in the epigastric region, the center of your chest (heartburn). If you do, it could also present as chest pain so I will guide you accordingly. I would also like to rule out any muscular pain, for which I will encourage you to take a muscle relaxant and see if it helps. Take tablet Muscoril (Thiocholchicoside 4 mg) one tablet once a day when you experience pain and let me know in the follow up in a couple of days to see if it relieves the pain. Like you said your Vitamin B12 levels are below normal, it could also be neuropathic pain for which I will only advise vitamin B12 supplements (tablet Methycolbalmine once a day for three months) or B complex supplements. You can also improve these levels with diet. Take diet enriched with beef, liver, and chicken. Fish and shellfish such as trout, salmon, tuna fish, and clams. Fortified breakfast cereal. Low-fat milk, yogurt, cheese, and eggs. Since your Hb is also below the ideal levels, take iron-rich foods which are usually Vitamin B12 rich as well. So I will advise diet modification to incorporate these in your everyday routine or take supplements with iron and Vitamin B12 as well. Because anemia can also present with the said symptoms. Lastly, I will encourage you to reduce weight with exercise and changing your diet and switching to a low-fat diet with the addition of more fruits and vegetables to your diet. Try to start with atleast 30-40 minutes of cardio workout every day and work it up from there according to your stamina and you will see the visible change that you feel. You will feel more active and fresh. Try to bring your BMI (body mass index) as close to the normal range as you can. Because obesity itself can cause countless problems as well. I hope this helps. ECG (electrocardiography). Do not lift heavyweights. Take low fat, high fiber diet. After two days.  ",

Complex malocclusion which require a lot of rotations and closure of gaps may take longer than usual.

So in order to give a definitive diagnosis, we would require your treatment history which includes - 1. Preoperative and post-operative clinic photographs (intraoral and extraoral both). 2. Preoperative dental x-rays (OPG and lateral cephalogram). 3. Treatment history including the types of malocclusion, brackets used, wires used and the movements caused. 4.

Beta blocker is the safest option available, although not the most effective one and other options are ablation or antiarrhrythmics. So trying behavioral techniques is a good option. But if it troubles you a lot then you may request low dose antiarrhythmics like Amiodarone for a short period of time, but they may again come back after the drug is stopped. Since there is no atrial fibrillation or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), antiarrhythmics are absolutely necessary, but the benefit would be in you is just symptomatic, which comes with the risk of side effects. However, you should have Holter at regular intervals like yearly (with echo for aortic regurgitation), or if you notice sustained ectopics or irregular rhythm implying development of fibrillation. You may discuss changing Atenolol to others like Metoprolol and see if its help. You should try to identify triggers like sleep or gastric disturbances, alcohol or smoking (if any), any particular medications (which you are on), stress, etc. Also, if not had recently, thyroid should be tested. So in a nutshell, antiarrhythmics may be avoided, but if not tolerable symptomatically then may be tried. I hope this helps.  ",

Well, you see the abdominal pain in such age is often an alarming finding, and I urge you to get him some investigations before giving any blanket cover of medicines. Common possibilities in his age are: 1. Mesenteric ischemia, which is the narrowing of the blood vessel supplying the blood to abdominal organs. This can frequently occur in old age with diabetes and hypertension. The pain arises because of lack of blood supply to organs like small bowel, large bowel, and others. 2. The second possibility is pain due to any organ within the abdomen which is inflamed commonly the pancreas (a gland over the back of the tummy), and large bowel. 3.

        "Doctor":"Hello.  As you have not mentioned the date of your last menstrual period, I am assuming by day 0 you mean the starting date of last menstrual cycle. Because we calculate the pregnancy age from that date. So yes, the early pregnancy time is very important because the embryo is developing in that time period. So as per your query, as you mentioned the consumption of wine in the early three weeks, I do not think it is gonna have any effect on the embryo because it is in the preovulatory phase when even the egg is being formed and released. And yes, corticosteroid in high doses when used for chronic medical conditions can have a risk of cleft lip and palate, but a single shot taken for an allergic reaction should not be affecting the baby. Also, the Flucloxacillin is a penicillin group of drug which is usually safe in pregnancy. So be calm and stop worrying about the risks. It will just increase your stress levels. Moreover in early pregnancy, if any embryo is grossly affected by any insult, it either usually aborts early if the exposure has been hazardous, but if the exposure is nonhazardous, it makes through and the baby will be fine. This is called all or none phenomenon in pregnancy. So your exposure to the medications was not that is something very dangerous, so rest assured. And more over your pregnancy has reached until 6 weeks, that is a good sign that the embryo has not been affected by the exposure to the drugs you have been worrying about. Please consult your gynecologist for your antenatal checkup and investigations required to be taken as per your local protocols. USG (ultrasound) for dating and viability. NT (nuchal) scan with dual marker test between 11-13 weeks. Routine antenatal investigations as per your local protocols. Tablet Folic Acid 5 mg daily once after food until 13-14 weeks. Avoid sexual intercourse until 14 weeks. Consult your gynecologist before any medications intake or to review the medications already taking for chronic medical conditions.  ",

I had a few glasses of wine from day 0 to day 20. A total of six maybe and one glass and a half on day 20. I also took corticosteroids (Betamethasone) a single dose of 3 mg due to an allergic reaction on day 20. And as if this was not enough, I was also on antibiotics (Flucloxacillin) which I finished on day 24 of pregnancy. I am so afraid all of this might have had an impact on the baby.

As you already have viral etiologies excluded this is time to look for other things which could lead to persistent elevation of the liver enzymes. Notably the Wilson, alpha, antitrypsin deficiency, hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis type II. I want you to upload all your previous investigations, ultrasound reports if done, and any other testing that you have been performed in the past two years. I also suggest you to get following blood tests which would help us excluding the above possibilities. It is possible that you have some testing already and I do not want that you should repeat it but do upload the reports as I can see those. Secondly, despite you had a viral screening that showed nothing abnormal but there are certain other tests like Hb core total which can tell occult or latent infection and cause of your raised enzyme levels. Since the investigation may cause you significant cost it is possible alternative that you can discuss with me in detail, as we can shrink some of those testings by closely inquiring about those causes in history before getting tested. I am sure we would reach a conclusive diagnosis by relevant information you provide and after investigations. Wilson. Hemochromatosis. Autoimmune hepatitis type II. Alpha antitrypsin deficiency. Chronic viral hepatitis. Complete blood count. Liver function test (fresh) and all previous as I can see the trend Hb core total. HbsAb, HbsAg. Serum ceruloplasmin.

You have two lower second premolars extracted with no third molars in the lower jaw. Little bit crowding is seen in both upper lateral incisors that might be the reason for you opting for braces. Well, as a specialist upper tooths have a little bit of space in between the central incisors. Upper front teeth need proximal slicing to facilitate space that space will be enough to realign your both upper lateral to the arch. Although it is just a front profile if possible upload a side profile of your face to evaluate the overjet but I can say just marginal and proximal slicing of the upper front teeth will be enough, and no further extraction needed. Meanwhile, you have missing both lower second premolars. Get a fixed bridge to cover the gaps or else they will shift and get malaligned. Upper third molar are also fine and does not need extraction in the near future. Go for normal braces instead of Invisalign. Normal braces work much better in these cases.  I hope this helps.  ",

        "Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern about symptoms complex and ultrasound findings and whether surgery is the answer to your problem. Well, first of all, I want to clear that you do not have stones in the gallbladder. They are concretions. It is a medical term and they are called microlithiasis (gall bladder stones less than 3 mm in size). So the possibility of developing cholecystitis (gall bladder inflammation) is very low. However, this microlithiasis can cause pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which is a gland sitting over the back of the abdomen). Thirdly, the pain can be secondary to the functional gall bladder problem, where the gall bladder is naturally slow resulting in damping of bile (yellow secretion produced by the liver and stored within gallbladder) and production of small concretions such as in y our case. So I would ask you to get a few blood tests to confirm whether you have pain due to pancreatitis. I also want that you should discuss to me in more detail about your pain, as only proper history can give me a clue towards your problem whether gall bladder inflammation, pancreatitis, or functional gall bladder disorder even before any further testing. Since the ultrasound findings and your symptoms are not correlated very well, there is no point in discussing the role of surgery. But I just want to assure you that you probably need no surgery, so do not worry about it. I suggest you some tests, please get it done, then I would recommend you some lifestyle changes and a medical treatment that can help you resolve your minor stones within the gallbladder. I hope this helps. Pancreatitis. Cholecystitis. Peptic ulcer disease. Functional gallbladder disorder (gallbladder dyskinesia). Complete blood count. Serum amylase and lipase. Liver function tests. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone). Start capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg half an hour before meals once daily for now. Follow up after investigation.  ",

You should get an ultrasound of liver to confirm it. Now since LDL (low density lipoprotein) is moderately elevated, you may give a try of a healthy lifestyle. So you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily, high calorie foods. Avoid fried, fast food, egg yellow, non veg consumption, and avoid excessive oil. Do not reuse the cooking oil once used for frying. Have regular exercises like brisk walking or running according to the capacity for atleast 30 minutes a day. Repeat lipid profile after eight weeks and if there is a response then should continue a healthy lifestyle or else will medications like tablet Atorva (Atorvastatin) 10 mg bedtime once daily for six to eight weeks. I hope this helps.  ",

        "Doctor":"Hi. If your gut is not normal, it will definitely affect your skin. First thing, include a lot of probiotics in your diet. Take two cups of curd daily. Have small frequent meals like two to three hours eat something. Your meal should be breakfast, lunch, and dinner with two intermittent snacks. Include ghee every day in your diet. Add one or two teaspoons ghee with rice along with other accompaniments. Stop the Cod liver capsules completely. Supplements should not be taken for years together. Occasionally if you eat homemade sweets, nothing will happen. You can take it as your weight is very low. For in-between snacks, you can eat fruits, buttermilk (include every day), protein powder in the evening, channa, etc. Always have protein-rich foods in the morning hours and the later meal should be light. Avoid breads, bakery products, processed foods, sodas, rich sweets, junks, etc. Get a complete blood test done. Follow up after a week with your reports.  ",

My diet has remained the same vegetarian, lactose-free, a decent amount of fruits and veggies, next to no sweets, ghee, butter, chapatis, and rice. I do not smoke at all and drink very infrequently.

The pain you have been experiencing is most likely the ovulatory pain, typical to occur in the midcycle when one has regular cycles of 28-30 days, or if you have you menstrual periods of varying dates, you can observe that exactly 14 days prior to the menstrual period. It is called Mitterschmerz syndrome or pain. It is a normal phenomenon and usually mild but rarely it can be severe. As your pain has been severe today, it would be better to get an ultrasound done to rule out any other causes of your pain. If you had mentioned the date of your last menstrual periods, it would have been helpful. You can take antispasmodic medications and see if the pain gets relieved, But if it does not, then it would be better to seek emergency medical help. And I am assuming that chances of pregnancy have been ruled out, if not then please evaluate yourself (just in case if sexually active). I hope this helps.  ",

In your query you have not mentioned the diagnosis so I can't suggest exactly what needs to be done but I will explain how it works .. The fact that you mentioned that she doesn't remember anyone could be a part of 1. Dementia for which you would require a neurologist , Medications can help to an extent . 2. Psychosis or Depression can have such reactions , you will require a Psychiatrist for this . A complete evaluation is required , the doctor might do a CT\/ MRI depending on the symptoms and start treatment accordingly and yes Medications can help to an extent depending on severity of the issue. One way is to get her treated on OPD basis ie at home with followuos with doctor , or you can opt for residential treatment facilities which keep the patient in the facility and there is a holistic approach to treatment where doctor , nurses , therapist , etc works as a team in recovery .

        "Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling, and inflammation on foot. I have gone through your investigations (attachment removed to protect patient identity) result and found that your Vitamin D3 level is below normal, GGT (gamma-glutamyl transferase) level slightly high, HDL (high dentisy lipoprotein) level below normal, TG (thyroglobulin) and VLDL (very density lipoprotein) level significantly high, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) level normal at the upper limit. Total leucocyte count with lymphocytes count slightly high, eosinophil count are significantly high. So your back pain, tiredness, more sleepy feeling with inflammation of foot may result from vitamin D3 deficiency. Clinical features of vitamin D3 deficiency are repeated infections, tiredness, back pain, depression, bone pain, muscle pain, fatigue, delayed wound healing, feeling sleepy, etc. Again high TG levels may cause abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, tiredness, fatigue, etc. Your high eosinophil count indicates that you may suffer from allergies. As your TSH level is normal at a higher limit, so you should repeat the thyroid function test within three months. For your vitamin D3 deficiency, you should need more exposure to sunlight for vitamin D3 synthesis as well as take vitamin D3 enriched foods and supplements. For your high TG level, you should continue Fenofibrate along with Omega-3 fatty acid for low HDL level and repeat your lipid profile test after three months. For your low back pain, you can take Naproxen with Esmoprazole combination with Baclofen and calcium supplements.  ",

        "Doctor":"Hi.  From the information given it seems you are experiencing the early signs of male pattern hair loss. This is a very common condition and there are many factors responsible, one of them being genetic. Due to the effect of the male hormone on the hair cycle, over a period of time the hair follicle starts shrinking and so the hair which comes out is thinner and more fragile and breaks easily. Also, the growing phase of the hair is shortened, so your hair does not grow as long it used to and becomes shorter and wispier. There are several treatment options available and the sooner we start the treatment the better the chances of reducing further hair loss\/thinning and increasing regrowth. A combination of oral supplements to boost hair growth along with the application of lotions containing Minoxidil 5% to begin with will be the best course of action in my opinion. Oral Finasteride, which is the male hormone blocker, is used frequently. Applications with Finasteride are available too. This will be prescribed by your treating doctor after assessing the extent of thinning and discussing the side effects, etc. Several preparations of biopeptides and other natural ingredients like saw palmetto extract, melatonin, etc are also available to boost hair growth. PRP (platelet-rich plasma) is a popular procedure that is often used in combination with medical treatment to stimulate hair growth further. Usually, a combination of treatments is suggested after the clinical evaluation. But using the applications regularly is the key to good results. Hair regrowth takes a few months to show and you will have to be patient to see the benefit of treatment. I hope this helps.  ",

You lead an erratic life. You are a smoker. You do not maintain your oral hygiene regularly. You also do not take your meal regularly.

Light and sound intolerance are features of migraine, but the other symptoms you explain, are more compatible with tension type headache. Nevertheless, I agree with your doctor treatment regarding Escitalopram. You should know that the sleep disorders are related to different causes depression, daily stress and anxiety, vitamin D deficiency, an abnormal sleep regime, caffeine intake, etc. I would recommend taking Vitamin D if there is low plasma levels of this vitamin. Regarding your sleep disorder, I would recommend starting Zolpidem for a couple of weeks 10 mg before sleep. You can try half a tablet before going to 10 mg. Melatonine intake can regulate your sleep rhythms too, but it is taken for a more prolonged time than Zolpidem and its effects are lower. A good sleeping hygiene (sleep always at the same time, avoid straining physical or emotional activities before sleep, avoid caffeine intake) would help too. If all these tips and drugs are not helpful, a prolonged brain EEG (electroencephalogram) during sleep would help diagnose any possible sleeping disorders. Regarding Flunarizine, I would explain that this is a calcium channel blocker and as such it can interact with calcium or vitamin D in high amounts. But usually it does not affect the calcium levels. You can try taking Escitalopram for three months initially and then try Flunarizine, if no good results on Escitalopram. I would not recommend taking them both initially. You should know that Escitalopram achieves its effect after three weeks from the starting, and the main changes to be seen are a reduce in the frequency of headaches and also mood changes (optimism). You can try taking Amitriptyline too, if you do not have any symptoms relief after the first month on Escitalopram. It can be really helpful with the sleep too. All the drugs have some adverse effects, but the benefits are higher. I hope this helps.  ",

With arthritis, there are 50 variants of it and it is very important to distinguish which one she has it as the management will differ for every arthritis. I would like to ask a few more queries: Any history of oral ulcers? Hairfall? Any history of fever? Which joints are affected? Swelling in the joints? Any deformity? Any changes in skin color or skin becoming tightened? Any history of dry eyes or dry mouth? Any muscle weakness which you have observed? With the start of Raynaud's, it seems like a systemic involvement more, something like lupus, but we need to rule it out. Kindly let me know these queries and I am advising a few tests. If they have been done, please attach the reports as well. CBC (complete blood count). ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate). CRP (C-reactive protein). Rheumatoid factor. Anti CCP antibody. A NA(by immunofloroscence). Serum creatinine. Urine routine. Connective tissue disease.  ",

        "Description":"Q. I have tinnitus and it does not subside on antibiotics. Why?",
        "Doctor":"Hi. The answer to your question entirely depends on how you developed the ear infection in the first place. In general, until the eardrum heals you will be having weird noises, tinnitus, and ear discomfort due to interference with sound transmission and processing. If the ear infection has happened secondary to recurrent allergy or cold, then you will have probably developed a eustachian tube catarrh due to which the fluid is still present in the middle ear causing the tinnitus and will take around two months approximately in toto for tinnitus to resolve. If the ear infection has occurred due to trauma (by earbuds etc), the tinnitus will take approximately four to six weeks, as this the average time it takes to heal the ear drum. I am sure you fall into one of the two possibilities mentioned above. There is absolutely nothing that you need to worry about as this usually takes a while for things to normalize. At the same time make sure there are no triggering factors out there. Some one they include use of earphones, headphones, exposure to loud sounds, consumption of alcohol, smoking, stress, etc. Try to maintain a healthy lifestyle as much as possible and do not think too much about the tinnitus nor try to Google about it too much. I hope this helps.  ",

This is very common especially in tropical countries and more so in the hot humid summers. To accurately diagnose the same, further information like images of the affected area, total duration of the rash, any other areas affected, any discoloration of nails, etc., are needed. If it is indeed a fungal infection the following can be kept in mind. Treatment of fungal infections includes applications which contain Ketoconazole, Sertaconazole, Luliconazole, etc. Oral antifungals like Terbinafine and Itraconazole are often used in combination for better clearance and reducing recurrences. Local hygiene is very important. Taking bath daily, drying the skin folds after bath, keeping soap and towels separate and drying your clothes in sunlight and ironing them before wearing will help to kill the fungal spores. So, I will recommend evaluation by a dermatologist to decide on the treatment. I hope this helps.  ",

Rise in heart rate with exercise and fall during rest is a normal phenomenon that is controlled by our autonomic nervous system. In healthy persons, it even falls in 40s during sleep. So, nothing to worry. The only thing that I would like to ask you is whether you have any symptoms such as dizziness during low pulse rate? Another thing is ECG (electrocardiogram). I want to see your ECG to see whether it is a sinus rhythm or is there any block. As your cardiac workup is done and is normal, I do not think you need any more work up but if there are occasional symptoms associated with low pulse rate as graying of vision, dizziness, etc, I would advise you to have a Holter monitoring done for 24 to 48 hours to see rise and fall of heart rate during daily activities including sleep. If you have no symptoms, just relax and do not worry.  ",

        "Description":"Q. Will hiatal hernia problem stay forever?",
        "Doctor":"Hello. I can very well understand your concern and at the start, I want to tell you that chronic straining does not lead to the development of hiatus hernia, however, your weight can. Hiatus hernia is an anatomical change that can present since birth, and after certain surgical procedures over abdomen or diaphragm, overweight to obese can develop hiatus hernia because of the excessive pressure over the stomach from belly fat, causing upward lifting of the lower part of food pipe and formation of hernia. And lastly, due to the old age when the diaphragmatic muscle gets weakened allowing part of the lower esophagus to get pulled in the lower part of the chest. In a young healthy people, diaphragmatic muscle is strong enough to prevent this from happening. Valsalva maneuver if performed vigorously can cause tears in the lower part of the esophagus which is an acute complication of this, but it will not alter the anatomy or produce a hiatus hernia. Valsalva can harm somebody if it is done without a reason (there are certain indications for medical conditions), but it can only cause damage to the lower part of the esophagus acutely but would not alter the anatomy of it i.e. hiatus hernia. Yes, an x-ray plain without contrast can easily miss a hiatus hernia. A special x-ray with contrast named barium is swallowed, and serial x-ray images from the chest are taken, that can diagnose the hiatus hernia instantly, however, a plain chest x-ray cannot detect the presence of hiatus hernia. So now coming to your second concern that you have to live with it. Well, it is not yet proven that you have a hiatus hernia, secondly, it is not uncommon to have hiatus hernia in people without any symptoms and it can remain undiagnosed until their whole life. The point is it can present harmlessly in human for years and years and does not necessitate any investigations. The time to develop a hiatus hernia is variable but it does take many years of overweight to cause hiatus hernia (very less likely within 6 to 12 months time). It is not a rule that every hiatus hernia would cause symptoms or disease or any complications. I would not suggest you even to worry about it and get tested for it. Because it would not change anything for you. Simple exercises, keeping a healthy lifestyle, reduce weight are all that is required. The weight loss is very compulsory, this will not only help you preventing hiatus hernia but also other things like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), bloating, gas distention, constipation. I hope this helps. Overweight. Barium swallow if worried about it, or have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux. Weight reduction. Follow up to discuss if any concern.  ",
        "Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old male who until recently weighed about 100 kg. For the last six months to a year, I was obsessively performing a Valsalva maneuver because I had health anxiety and OCD and I was worried about an operation. When I was younger I could have impacted my continence. I have been having some GI issues lately and read that you can cause a hiatal hernia from chronic straining. Is it possible that I could have caused a hiatal hernia at my age? Are six months to a year chronic enough? If I have caused a hiatal hernia will it stay forever? Or can I reduce it and the hernia size through exercise to tone and strengthen the diaphragm and weight loss? I am extremely worried I have caused a hernia and will have to live with it forever. I have had a standard x-ray of the chest which came back normal. Could a hernia have been missed?"
